# Anki Flagged Card Notifier

Will display a notification if flagged cards exist after syncing.

Sometimes I add cards from my Anki smartphone app which I want to edit properly afterwards on my computer but I forget
about it, so I created this addon.

## Install

Link it to your addon directory.

On MacOS just run
```sh
./install_macos.sh
```
